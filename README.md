# Collaborative Text Editor

## This is a real-time collaborative text editor similar to Google Docs, built with modern web technologies. Here are the key aspects:

Architecture:
•  Frontend: React-based client application with components for text editing
•  Backend: Node.js WebSocket server for real-time communication
•  Real-time sync: Uses WebSockets for instant collaboration between multiple users

Key Features:

1. Real-time Collaboration: Multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously and see each other's changes instantly
2. CRDT Implementation: Uses a Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) algorithm to handle concurrent edits without conflicts. This is sophisticated conflict resolution technology that ensures:
•  All users see the same final document state
•  No data loss when multiple users edit simultaneously
•  Proper handling of insertions and deletions at different positions
3. User Awareness: Shows the number of active users currently editing the document
4. Automatic Reconnection: WebSocket connection automatically reconnects if it drops
